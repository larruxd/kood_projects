# GraphQL

### About

The objective of this project was to learn the GraphQL query language, by creating my own profile page.
I used the GraphQL endpoint which is provided by the platform (https://01.kood.tech/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql) to query the data necessary to fill the page.

The profile has 3 sections: **xp**, **level** and **audit ratio**.

The 4th section has 2 graphs. One is a spider graph that displays skill data and the other is a graph that displays xp progression over time. You can see more info when hovering over a graph.

More info about the subject [here](https://01.kood.tech/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/graphql)

### Testing / auditing

Audit questions [here](https://01.kood.tech/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/graphql/audit)

The page is being hosted at [github-pages](https://larruxd.github.io/graphql).

You can test the code yourself by using "Live Server" extention on VScode

or running it with go server

`$ go run .`
